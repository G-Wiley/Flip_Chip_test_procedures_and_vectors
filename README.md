# Flip_Chip_test_procedures_and_vectors
This repository contains Flip Chip module test data sheets and related test vector files. The test data sheets describe scope loop tests that use test vector files to verify and debug Flip Chip modules on the tester. Present test data sheets and vectors support the following boards:
<br>•	M452 Variable Clock
<br>•	G624 Resistor Board test procedure (no vector files required)
<br>•	M700 Manual Timing Generator
