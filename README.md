This repository contains Flip Chip module test data sheets and related test vector files.

The test data sheets describe scope loop tests that use test vector files to verify and debug Flip Chip modules on the tester. Present test data sheets and vectors support the following boards:
<br>•	G020 Sense Amp
<br>•	G228 Inhibit Driver
<br>•	G624 Resistor Board test procedure (no vector files required for this test)
<br>•	M160 Gate Module (fixes bad vector in original M160 test file)
<br>•	M452 Variable Clock
<br>•	M700 Manual Timing Generator
<br><br>
Link to the library of original test vector files for the Stearns Flip Chip tester:
<br><a href="https://svn.so-much-stuff.com/svn/trunk/pdp8/warren/16bit/tests/">https://svn.so-much-stuff.com/svn/trunk/pdp8/warren/16bit/tests/</a>
<br>This is a link to a folder on the so-much-stuff.com site created and maintained by Vince Slyngstad. It's important to mention this because most of the 
test vector files needed to debug PDP-8/I and PDP-8/L modules on the Stearns tester are the vector files in Vince's .../16bit/tests/ folder.
