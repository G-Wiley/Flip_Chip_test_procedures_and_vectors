# Flip_Chip_test_procedures_and_vectors
This repository contains Flip Chip module test data sheets and related test vector files. The test data sheets describe scope loop tests that use test vector files to verify and debug Flip Chip modules on the tester. Present test data sheets and vectors support the following boards:
<br>•	G624 Resistor Board test procedure (no vector files required for this test)
<br>•	M452 Variable Clock
<br>•	M700 Manual Timing Generator
<br><br>

<br>This is a link to a folder on the so-much-stuff.com site created and maintained by Vince Slyngstad. It's important to mention this because most of the 
test vector files needed to debug PDP-8/I and PDP-8/L modules on the Stearns tester are the vector files in this folder.
